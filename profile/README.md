# Dev Bootcamp GitHub Org Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Dev Bootcamp S23 Organization! This is where all the course lectures, exercises, and projects will live! Bootcampers will each have access to their own repositories where they can upload completed exercises and projects. An organization allows your work to be grouped together, so others can view it. 

## Getting Started
Here are the steps Bootcampers will take in order to get started with the Org. 

### Git Ready! - Install Git
Git is a developer tool used to track file changes and much more.
#### Mac
1. Open the Terminal app via Spotlight search
2. Check if you have Git installed already by typing the command `git` 
	1. If you get a prompt asking "Would you like to install the tools now?" (Xcode Dev tools), selected **Install**
	2. If you see a list of common Git commands, continue to the next step
3. Configure your Git username by typing the command `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
4. Configure your Git email by typing the command `git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"` (Typically this is the email you will use to sign up for GitHub)
5. Congrats you installed Git!

#### Windows
1. Visit https://git-scm.com and download the Windows Installer
2. Open the Windows Installer on your computer and go through the prompts
3. Open GitBash
4. Configure your Git username by typing the command `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
5. Configure your Git email by typing the command `git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"` (Typically this is the email you will use to sign up for GitHub)
6. Congrats you installed Git!



### Create GitHub Account
A GitHub account will allow you to be added to this organization, so you can pull and push to repos and work on your projects collaboratively.
1. Go to https://github.com and **Sign up** to create an account or **Log in** if you already have one
2. Create a username and password
3. Verify an email
4. Send a message in the `gt-bootcamp-dev` Slack channel with your GitHub username, and an instructor will add you to the organization
5. Accept the invite to the GitHub Organization in your email

## Submitting Projects & Exercises
Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen. 

At the beginning of the semester, Bootcampers should fork the `bootcamp-s23` repository in this organization. This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. Once the repo is forked, bootcampers should:
- name the new repo `bootcamp-s23-name` in the organization
- download the `bootcamp-s23-name` repo onto their computer
- follow the instructions given on the new repo README
	- initialize a git repo
	- add changes
	- commit changes
	- add a remote
	- create a main branch
	- push changes

Bootcampers now have their very own repo in the organization where they can push their code to. Bootcampers should also frequently **Sync Fork** to make sure they have up-to-date exercises and projects.
